      <h3>ME</h3>
      <p>I am Johnnie Hernandez (Jay) a mathematician and computer scientist currently residing in RTP/Durham North Carolina.  
	  Originally from California I have spent the last several years of my life primarily in North Carolina only leaving during 
	  intermissions when pulled away for military service.I have a deep interest in mathematics, science, technology and other 
	  related fields.  I wanted to add this section so that hopefully you could learn a small bit about me and so 
	  that I could say “Hello World”.
	  </p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>The first institute I have formally studied in was through the military vocational school where
	  I learned electrical and computer systems repairs for the United States Army.
	  There we covered a large skill set ranging from AC/DC electrical systems to computer software and networking.
	  Second I have had the good fortune of studying Mathematics and Computer Science at East Carolina University.
	  In specific in those fields I have studied logic, differential equations, data management, with a bit of focus in functional programming.   
	  Outside of schools however I spend a lot of time balancing a personal education between physics and computer science/technology.  
	  In specific I have been attempting to gain a larger understanding of quantum geometry and its application to modern scientific 
	  queries while also studying data management and numerical analysis.  I find that the largest tools currently at our disposal 
	  in the field of science are computers and the unique ability they contain to sort through large amounts of information in short periods of time.
	  So a primary focus of my studies have been ways that we as a society can utilize machines to a higher level of efficiency than we currently do.
	  </p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
	  If I were to attempt to sum my goals up into a single idea, I would say it would be that I wish to commit
	  to a cause that will improve the day to day life of our society.  I truly believe that we can do best by
	  ourselves by doing the best by others.  For me I would like to get into a field of technology, in specific
	  research and development.  I feel here would be the greatest use of my ability to help others on a large scale.
	  I am not foolish enough to believe that I will just fall into this line of work or that luck will be enough to carry
	  my way through.  I do however believe that in order to gain a place in this field I can overcome any obstacles 
	  in my way through hard work, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to the future.
	  </p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Philosophy</h3>
      <p>For a majority of my life I have had a deep focus in understanding the question “Why”.  
	  This has illuminated the brightest in life with my interest in mathematics. What is Math?  
	  From my point of view mathematics is the process of interpreting our universe, the act 
	  of creating a buffer between our minds and the universe we exist in.  A mathematicians’ 
	  job is to be a translator of this language. And like any translation there is always room for 
	  error or lost in meaning, and it falls within our duty to continually adapt our understandings 
	  as we learn more and more about the world.  We may not like what we hear but to a certain 
	  degree we must always agree with it and at the same point always play the devils advocate 
	  and try to disprove it.  Finally when when we develop that understanding of science and
	  technology we then apply that to granting a higher quality of life not only to oursleves 
	  but to society as a whole.
